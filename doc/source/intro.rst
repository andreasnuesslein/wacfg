About wacfg
===========
Wacfg has been written (during `GSoC <http://code.google.com/soc/>`_) as a drop-in replacement for Gentoo's webapp-config.

However, it is **NOT** compatible with webapp-config, you will not be able to work with your old installed instances.

See :ref:`Installation <installation>` for instructions.
